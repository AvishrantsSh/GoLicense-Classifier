# How to Contribute

First things first, thanks for taking your time to contribute!

To get started with contributing to the code,

1. Fork the Project

2. Create your Feature Branch
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
3. Setup your development environment using:
    ```sh
    make dev
    ```

## Testing

We have a handful of tests to ensure that the code is working as expected. You can run the tests in your environment using:
```sh
make test
```

## Submitting changes

Once done with your changes, you can submit them to the project by pushing them to your fork of the project. After that open a pull request to the main repository.


Writing a clear log message for your commits will help others to understand the purpose of your commit. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
